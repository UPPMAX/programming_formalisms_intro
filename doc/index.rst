Programming formalisms — Introduction day
=========================================

.. admonition:: Course punchlines
   
    - "Turning scripters into computer scientists”
    - "Add theory to bolster already present practical skills"
   


.. admonition:: This course aims to 
   
   - give scientists
       ... with some experience in programming and scripting 
       
       - an understanding of the underlying principles of software development, design, and programming. 
      
   - strengthen the understanding of:
      - more advanced programming concepts
      - ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular programming 
      - enable a better understanding of how to evaluate a script or programs performance.
   - encourage the use of software development tools, like:
      - Unified Model Language
      - Git and Github
   - **convince the benefits of sharing and social coding**

Some practicals
----------------
        
ZOOM
++++

.. important::

    - The course is run over Zoom. You should have gotten an email with the links
           
    - When you join the Zoom meeting, use your REAL NAME.
    
    - Please MUTE your microphone when you are not speaking and 
    
      - use the “**Raise hand**” functionality under the “Participants” window during the lecture. 
    
    - Behave politely!
    - There will be breakout rooms used in the Zoom for some of the exercises. You will be randomly assigned to one of them the first day. The other days there will be defined groups.  
    
    - Use **Zoom chat only**:
    
       - in breakout rooms 
       - for Zoom specific technical issues
    
    
Collaboration document HackMD
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: 

    - Use the HackMD page for the workshop with your questions.
    - Tell us directly if it is too fast or you need clarification.
    
       -  Either a helper will answer the question or the helper will pose the question to the teacher.
     
    - Depending on how many helpers there are we'll see how fast there are answers. 
    
        - Some answers may come after the workshop.
 
    - Type in the left frame 
    
        - "-" means new bullet and <tab> indents the level.
        - don't focus too much on the formatting if you are new to "Markdown" language!
    
    - **Have a try with the Icebreaker question**
    
.. discussion:: Icebreaker

   - Where do you work?

The teachers 
------------

- Lars Eklund, lars.eklund@uppmax.uu.se
- Björn Claremar, bjorn.claremar@uppmax.uu.se

Reflections at the end of day
-----------------------------
- Students will have the opportunity to give feedback to the teachers at the end of each day. 
- A reflection session will be conducted in a similar fashion to an Agile Software Development retrospective meeting. '
- It is important that all students and teachers involved in the lessons actively engage in this event.
