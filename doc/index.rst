Programming formalisms — Introduction day
=========================================

.. admonition:: Course punchlines
   
    - "Turning scripters into computer scientists”
    - "Add theory to bolster already present practical skills"
   
.. Exercise:: This course aims to 
   
   - give scientists
       ... with some experience in programming and scripting:  
       
       - an understanding of the underlying principles of software development, design, and programming. 
      
   - strengthen the understanding of:
      - more advanced programming concepts
      - ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular programming 
      - enable a better understanding of how to evaluate a script or programs performance.
   - encourage the use of software development tools, like:
      - Unified Model Language
      - Git and Github
   - **convince the benefits of sharing and social coding**

.. admonition:: Content and expectations

   - We will cover an introduction to 
   
      - **Algorithms and Data structures:    *Programming skills*, *Train logic***
      - Programming Paradigms:    *Classical training*, *Big-picture architecture of programs*
            - especially structured:    *Readable code*
            - functional programming:    *Modular development*
            - modular development:    *Modular development*
            - code reusability:    *Reusable code*
            - Object oriented programming:    *Modular development*, *Object-oriented programming*
            - testing:    *Best practices*
            - optimisation:    *Optimize*
             
      - Reproducible research:
            - dependencies    *Package development*, *Make tools that other people can also benefit from*
            - documentation    *Readable code*, *Make tools that other people can also benefit from*
      - Tools:   
            - UML:    *Best practice*
            - git:    *Best practice*
            - github:   *Make tools that other people can also benefit from*
            - NBIS *best practices*: https://github.com/NBISweden/development-guidelines
            
    
   - The course modules will cover theory with bridging practical examples and applications to enhance the theoretical understanding of the principles.
   
   

.. prereq::

   - Python
   - Git
   - GitHub
   - PlanUML
   - |:bulb:| Visual Studio code can work as an integrated environment
   - See the `setup.md <https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalism/blob/main/setup.md>`_ file

Some practicals
---------------
        
ZOOM
++++

.. important::

    - The course is run over Zoom. You should have gotten an email with the links
           
    - When you join the Zoom meeting, use your REAL NAME.
    
    - Please MUTE your microphone when you are not speaking and 
    
      - use the “**Raise hand**” functionality under the “Participants” window during the lecture. 
    
    - Behave politely!
    - There will be breakout rooms used in the Zoom for some of the exercises. 
    
    - Use **Zoom chat only**:
    
       - in breakout rooms 
       - for Zoom specific technical issues
       - **otherwise use HackMD, see below**
    
    
Collaboration document HackMD
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. important:: 

    - Use the HackMD page for the workshop with your **questions**.
    - <https://hackmd.io/lPmOnlj4Qw6FSVgizuFJKg?both>
    - Tell us directly if it is too fast or you need clarification.
    
       -  Either a helper will answer the question or the helper will pose the question to the teacher.
     
    - Depending on how many helpers there are we'll see how fast there are answers. 
    
        - Some answers may come after the workshop.
 
    - Type in the left frame 
    
        - "-" means new bullet and <tab> indents the level.
        - don't focus too much on the formatting if you are new to "Markdown" language!
    
    - **Have a try with the Icebreaker question**
    
.. discussion:: Icebreaker

   - What topic do you work with?

Interctive questions/discussion
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. important:: 

   - **Menti:**
   - <https://www.menti.com/al15tk57h9md>
   - <https://www.menti.com> with code valid the week: `69 32 18 8`
   
.. discussion:: Icebreaker

   - Which city do you work in?

Reflections at the end of day
-----------------------------
- Students will have the opportunity to give feedback to the teachers at the end of each day. 
- A reflection session will be conducted in a similar fashion to an Agile Software Development retrospective meeting.
- It is important that all students and teachers involved in the lessons actively engage in this event.
