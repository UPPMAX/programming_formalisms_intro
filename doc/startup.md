# Start the project
```{Objectives}
   - Think about structure of the files and folders for the project
   - Think about documentation already
```

```{note}
- Many projects/scripts start as something for personal use, but expands to be distributed.
- Let's start in that end and be prepared.
- The following steps can be very valuable for you in a couple of months as well as you revisit your code and don't know what it does or why you did this and that.
```

## Order your files!

- Think that **everything is worth to be part of documentation** (like GitHub directory tree)
- The parts from the software development cycle
  - The planning parts
      - Requirements: 
        - what should the program deliver
        - dependencies
        - OS platforms
      - Risk analysis
  - Design documentation
      - Analysis: pseudo code and UML
  - Source code
    - with in-code documentation
  - README
  - (Full documentation)
  - (Tutorial)

```{admonition} Directory structure
Different projects should have separate folders
  - ReadMe file
  - Data		(version controlled)(.gitignore)
  - Processed data	intermediate
  - (Manuscript)	
  - Results		data, tables, figures (version controlled, git tags for manuscript version)
  - Src		version controlled code
    - License (here or in the 1st level)
    - Requirements.txt
  - Doc
    - index
```

```{note}
- If software is reused in several projects it can make sense to put them in its own repo, not connected to a specific research project

```

## Start with a new GitHub project

```{note}
- For the course project we do it in this order, but that is not necessary in all cases.
- Typically you may start locally in Git repository and later push to a GitHub repository (more next session about Git)
- The reason for starting here is that we can get our PlantUML render in the browser!
```

### Type-along: Create a new repository on GitHub

``````{type-along}
Make sure that you are **logged into GitHub**.

```{figure} img/New_repo.png
:width: 60%
:class: with-border

To create a repository we either click the green button "New" (top left corner).
```

```{figure} img/new-top-right.png
:width: 60%
:class: with-border

Or if you see your profile page, there is a "+" menu (top right corner).
```

---

On this page choose a project name, e.g. ``planets-<username>`` 
  - the name there so there are no clashes when/if you collaborate and fork other repositories)
   
For the sake of this exercise **do select**
"Initialize this repository with a README"
and
"Choose a license"
- Let's choose MIT (we may discuss this later on

```{figure} img/New_repo_formalisms.png
:width: 100%
:class: with-border
```

**Done!**

**Let's view the license!**
- There are prewritten text for the different types.
- More info at [Licensing](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/sharing_deeper.html#licensing)

``````

## README files

**Advantages**
- Versioned (goes with the code development)
- It is often good enough to have a `README.md` or `README.rst` along with your code/script
- If you use README files, use either
  [RST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) or
  [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)
- A great guide to README files: [MakeaREADME](https://www.makeareadme.com/)

````{keypoints}
README file should include:

  - A descriptive project title

  - Motivation (why the project exists)

  - How to setup

  - Copy-pastable quick start code example

  - Recommended citation
````

**We are ready to**
- Extend the README file
- Make some folders according to the above list
- Put the planning documents in a docs folder

````{challenge} 10 min
1. Extend the README file a little bit with an **About section** in Markdown format describing the project.
  - Use the **Pencil** button
  - Use the goals stated in last session, [Analysis](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/flowcharts.html#analysis)
  - Get inspiration from <https://www.makeareadme.com/> and a favorite Git repo or <https://github.com/yampelo/beagle>. 


```markdown
**Cheat sheet**
# This is a section in Markdown   

## This is a subsection           

Nothing special needed for        
a normal paragraph.               

    This is a code block          


**Bold** and *emphasized*.       

A list:                           
- this is an item                 
- another item                   
               
```

2. Create the planning document in markdown **Add file** button and choose "Create file".
  - Call the file ``doc/plan.md``
	- this will on the fly create the directory ``doc``.
  - Copy paste the example code found in the last session for [PlantUML](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/flowcharts.html#lets-make-a-flowchart-of-the-program-parts) and [pseudocode](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/flowcharts.html#do-some-pseudocode-of-the-calculations).
    - Type ``"```uml"`` (without ") above the UML code and ``"```"`` below, and it should render nicely.
    - Type ``"```code"`` (without ") above the pseudo code and ``"```"`` below, and it should render nicely.
  - Add some suitable headings for the code sections

# Plan

## Background
- The climate last about 1 million years has been largely determined but the change of the eccentricity (elongation) of Earth's orbit (One of the [Milankovitch cycles](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/)).
- The glacial cycles (daily speaking: ice ages) with a period of about 100 000 years are thought to be due to this.
  - Theory: The gravity form the other planets, especially Jupiter, causes the change of the eccentricity
- **Problem**: Reproduce Milankovitch cycle of eccentricity (100ka)
- **Method**: Use Python
  - Let's go for functional programming
- **Input**: Some initial positions of the planets but no external data
  - Perhaps also user input of length of simulation
- **Output**: Graph of orbits and a timeseries of an eccentricity parameter

**Development steps** (we extend the program with iterations)
1. Earth-sun system
1. Add Jupiter
1. Make modular
1. Add more planets?

## PlantUML

```uml
@startuml
skin rose
title Planet flowchart
start

:define some parameters;
:initialize earth (and Jupiter);

repeat
  :calculate new position;
  :calculate acceleration;
  :calculate velocity in two dimensions;

repeat while (simulation time is met) is (no)
->yes;
:figure plotting;
stop
```

## Pseudocode

```code
Define constants
Define initial values
	positions
	velocity (balance of gravity and centrifugal force)
(Allocate (book) space for long vectors	plan iteration)
Iteration
	Change of positions
	Calc acc (gravity)
	Calc new velocity
Plot resulting ellipses
Calculate orbit parameters
Plot time series of parameter change
```

## What is Git, and what is a Git repository?

- Git is a version control system: can **record/save snapshots** and track the content of a folder as it changes over time.
- Every time we **commit** a snapshot, Git records a snapshot of the **entire project**, saves it, and assigns it a version.
- These snapshots are kept inside a sub-folder called `.git`.
- If we remove `.git`, we remove the repository and history (but keep the working directory!).
- `.git` uses relative paths - you can move the whole thing somewhere else and it will still work
- Git doesn't do anything unless you ask it to (it does not record anything automatically).
- Multiple interfaces to Git exist (command line, graphical interfaces, web interfaces).

  
```{admonition} Concepts in Git
- **repository**: The project, contains all data and history (commits, branches, tags).
- **add**: Stage you files (collect what to be added to the git record — a kind of middle step)
- **commit**: Snapshot of the project, gets a unique identifier (e.g. `c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e`).
- **cloning**: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the first time. It is not necessary to download each file one by one.
- `git clone` copies everything: all commits and all branches.
- Branches on the remote appear as (read-only) local branches with a prefix, e.g. `origin/main`.
- We synchronize commits between local and remote with `git fetch`/`git pull` and `git push`.
```
   
## Before we continue we need to configure Git

```{prereq}

   -  **Git and GitHub should be configured prior to the course**
      following [Setup](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/setup.html).
      - Test: ``ssh -T git@github.com``
        - Output should be something like this: ``Hi bclaremar! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.``


   -  Being comfortable with the command line. No expertise is required, but the lesson will be mostly taken from the command line.
   -  Students should be familiar with using a **text editor** on their system.
      - Emacs and Vim are excellent choices if you know how to use them
      - but Nano or
      - Notepad on Windows are sufficient.
      
```    
   
```{Attention}
- Start your terminal of choice
   - Terminal in Visual Studio code
   - MAC terminal 
   - iTerm (Mac)
   - Git BASH  (Windows)
   - WSL (Windows subsystem Linux) environment in
     - MobaxTerm
     - Powershell
   - PowerShell

```

If you haven't already configured Git, please follow the instructions in the
[installation instructions](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/setup.html#shell-and-git).

```console
$ git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
$ git config --global user.email <your GitHub-connected email address>
$ git config --global core.editor nano
```
or replace nano with another editor, like in Windows: ``notepad``
Verify with:
```console
$ git config --list
```
- Also, test:
- ``ssh -T git@github.com``

- Output should be something like this:
- ``Hi bclaremar! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.``

## Cloning our Plane repository to local

Now you and other people can clone this repository and contribute changes. 


``````{type-along}
- You may want to create a directory for this course. You can do it in the normal way or use your terminal, like this in a good place (like "Courses" if you have that)
  - ``cd Courses``
  - ``mkdir Programming_formalisms``
  - ``cd Programming_formalisms``
- In GitHub, locate the **Code** button, select **SSH** and click the *copy* symbol to the right
- Back in your terminal type ``git clone`` followed by pasting the copied text.
- The result shall look something like this:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:<user>/planet-<user>.git
```
```{tip}
- Using the SSH makes it very straight-forward to upload your local changes back ot GitHub. Use HTTP if you clone repos that do not belong to you or your group.
```

- This creates a directory called ``planet-<user>`` unless it already exists.

What just happened?
- `cd` the new directory that was created
- list the files with `ls`
- **Think of cloning as downloading the `.git` part to your computer**. 
- After downloading the `.git` part the branch pointed to by HEAD is automatically checked out.
``````

## Working on GitHub

- You can do basically the **same work at GitHub as in your local git repo**
- The **graphical view** makes it easier to work with in everyday editing work at least.
  - Depends on your own preferences of course.
- Here your commit each file at a time with the "commit button". 
  - **No staging** that is.
  - Be aware of that feature!
- **GitHub Actions** are workflows defined by you, like:
  - for automatic testing after each commit (Used in the test lessons)
  - for GitHub Pages, briefly covered in last session today or Extra reading: [Documentation](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/documentation_deeper.html).

```{seealso}

```{keypoints}
- A repository can have one or multiple remotes (we will revisit these later).
- A remote (GitHub) in this case serves as a full backup of your work.
- Code development might be easier to develop in the local git repo since you can run and test locally in an easy way.
```
