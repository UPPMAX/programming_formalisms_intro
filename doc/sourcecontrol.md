# The iterations and Git
```{questions}
  - Why should you use source/version control?
```

```{Discussion} Have you used Git (locally) in your own work?
Answer in **Menti**
```

```{Objectives}
   - We will
      - work with the basic commands in git
      - go through branching and merging
```

```{note}
- We will cover the most basic things with Git such that you can use it this week.
- For deeper understanding and hands-on on branching etcetera, please confer the course material of [NBIS](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/course_2104/git/) and [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).
```


## Start with pushing your changes in the local Git to GitHub

 ```console
  $ git push
  ```

You should now see something like:

```text
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 846 bytes | 846.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 7 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.

```

``````{admonition} If you get errors

If you instead get something like the below, your SSH keys are not correctly configured. 
```text

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```
If `ssh -T git@github.com` gives an error, this is the case.

**Reload your GitHub project website and - taa-daa - your commits should now be
online!**

What just happened? **Think of publishing a repository as uploading the `.git` part online**.

## Alternative way to initialize Git

```{admonition} A new repository from an existing project on own computer or HPC user account.

- Say you’ve got an existing project that you want to start tracking with git.

    - Go into the directory containing the project.
    - Type `git init`.
    - Type `git add` to add all of the relevant files.
    - You’ll probably want to create a `.gitignore` file right away, to indicate all of the files you don’t want to track. Use `git add .gitignore`, too.
    - Type `git commit`.

```

- **Do not run because we changed from 2 years simulation time to 5000 years!**
- The output should look like this at least.

- Do **not** stage (add) yet!

**Discussion**
- That's long code!
- Perhaps make modular?
- The orbits seems too elliptic in the plot. The axes should be equal!
- Let's look at that in the next iteration!

## Stage and commit the changes

``````{type-along}
- Now first stage and then commit (what happens when we leave out the `-m` flag?):

```console
  $ git add python.py     # <-- we can state exactly which file to stage as well
  $ git commit                   # <-- we have left out -m "..."
```

  When you leave out the `-m` flag, Git should open an editor where you can edit
  your commit message. This message will be associated and stored with the
  changes you made. This message is your chance to explain what you've done and
  convince others (and your future self) that the changes you made were
  justified.  Write a message (like ``added Jupiter`` and save and close the file.

  When you are done committing the changes, experiment with these commands:

  ```console
  $ git log
  $ git log --stat
  $ git log --oneline
  ```
``````

## Ignoring files and paths with .gitignore

Compiled and generated files are not
committed to version control. There are many reasons for this:

- Your code could be run on different platforms.
- These files are automatically generated and thus do not contribute in any meaningful way.
- The number of changes to track per source code change can increase quickly.
- When tracking generated files you could see differences in the code although you haven't touched the code.

For this we use `.gitignore` files. Read more https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms_intro/git_deeper.html

- Not important for our project right now.
- **But**, we should had omitted the virtual environment, i.e. the directory ``planet-project``.

## Branching and merging
Software development is often not linear:

- We typically need at least one version of the code to "work" (to compile, to give expected results, ...).
- At the same time we work on new features, often several features concurrently.
  Often they are unfinished.
- We need to be able to separate different lines of work really well.

```{figure} img/git-collaborative.svg
:alt: Isolated tracks
:width: 50%

Isolated tracks of work.
```

The strength of version control is that it permits the researcher to **isolate
different tracks of work**, which can later be merged to create a composite
version that contains all changes.

- We see branching points and merging points.
- Main line development is often called `master` or `main`.
- Other than this convention there is nothing special about `master` or `main`, it is just a branch.
- Commits form a directed acyclic graph (we have left out the arrows to avoid confusion about the time arrow).

A group of commits that create a single narrative are called a **branch**.
There are different branching strategies, but it is useful to think that a branch
tells the story of a feature, e.g. "fast sequence extraction" or "Python interface" or "fixing bug in
matrix inversion algorithm".

### Typical workflows

One typical workflow:

```console
$ git checkout -b new-feature  # create branch, switch to it
$ git commit                   # work, work, work, ..., and test
$ git checkout master          # once feature is ready, switch to master
$ git merge new-feature        # merge work to master
$ git branch -d new-feature    # remove branch
```

```{note}
[More about branches](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/branches/)
```

## Let's make our code modular (test in branch)

``````{challenge} Make four modules (10-15 minutes in BO)
- First make a branch called ``modularity`` and go to that branch
```console
$ git checkout -b modularity    # create branch, switch to it
$ git branch                    # check that we are on the new branch
```
- We can now do our changes
- We will make four files
  - ``planet_main.py``, containing an overview e.g. the main program
  - ``planet_data.py``, containing general constants, and planetary parameters
  - ``planet_iter.py``, containing the equation of motion for the planets
  - ``planet_functions.py``, containing eccentricity calculations and a plot function

- add and commit, possibly several times

## Meanwhile...  
  
````{typealong}

**Back in main branch**
- We spotted some unnecessary ``print`` lines in the main branch code.
- Go to the main branch:
```git
git checkout main
```
 
- Let's remove the two print lines around row 80 in the second for-loop.
- add and commit

```git
git add planet.py
git commit -m "rm print"  
```

````  
  
- We can now check the history with a command that graphically tries to show the log with branches

````{tip}

**An important alias**

We will now define an *alias* in Git, to be able to nicely visualize branch structure in the terminal without having to remember a long Git command.

```console
$ git config --global alias.graph "log --all --graph --decorate --oneline"
``` 
  
This will enable you to use ``git graph`` for short
````  

- It will give you something like this:

  
```git 
  
$ git graph
* 413d0e3 (HEAD -> master) rm printing output
| * fc007d4 (modular) modular code
|/
* 5434395 add Jupiter
* f3c1fb5 planet.py
...
```

  
## Merging

- It turned out that our experiment with modularity was a good idea. 
- Our goal now is to merge modularity into main.
 
```{figure} img/git-collaborative.svg
:alt: Isolated tracks
:width: 50%

Isolated tracks of work.
```
``````{challenge} Merge into main
- once all features are ready, switch to main
```console
$ git checkout main    # switch to main branch
$ git branch           # check that we are on main branch
$ git merge  modularity          # merge modularity into main
```
- let's now check the graphical view:
  
```git
$ git graph
*   dc3f83f (HEAD -> main) modular
|\
| * fc007d4 (modularity) modular code
* | 413d0e3 rm printing output
|/
* 5434395 add Jupiter
* f3c1fb5 planet.py

```

``````

## Summary

- Now we know how to save snapshots:

```console
$ git add <file(s)>
$ git commit
```

- And that is what we do as we program.
- Other very useful commands are these:

```console
$ git init    # initialize new repository
$ git add     # add files or stage file(s)
$ git commit  # commit staged file(s)
$ git status  # see what is going on
$ git log     # see history
$ git diff    # show unstaged/uncommitted modifications
$ git show    # show the change for a specific commit
$ git mv      # move tracked files
$ git rm      # remove tracked files
$ git checkout -b wild-idea    # create branch, switch to it, work, work, work ...
$ git checkout main          # realize it was a bad idea, back to main/master
$ git branch -D wild-idea      # it is gone, off to a new idea
$ git merge 
```

## In-code documentation

- Comments, function docstrings, ...
- Advantages
  - Good for programmers
  - Version controlled alongside code
  - Can be used to auto-generate documentation for functions/classes
- Disadvantage
  - Probably not enough for users
   
````{discussion} In BO:s?
**Comments examples**

Let's take a look at two example comments (comments in python start with `#`):

**Comment A**
```python
# Now we check if temperature is larger then -50:
if temperature > -50:
    print('do something')
```

**Comment B**
```python
# We regard temperatures below -50 degrees as measurement errors
if temperature > -50:
    print('do something')
```
Which of these comments is best? Can you explain why?
````
```{solution} Solution
- Comment A describes **what** happens in this piece of code, whereas comment B describes **why** this piece of code is there, i.e. its **purpose**.
- Comments in the form of B are much more useful, comments of form A are redundant and we should avoid them.
```

**Why and not how**


### Function docstrings
A docstring is a structured comment associated to a segment of code (i.e. function or class)

Good docstrings describe:
   - What the function does
   - What goes in (including the type of the input variables)
   - What goes out (including the return type)
   - Python example: help(<function name>)
  
**Example**
  
```python
def mean_temperature(data):
    """

```{Keypoints}
- Initializing a Git repository is simple: git init.
- Commits should be used to tell a story.
- Git uses the .git folder to store the snapshots.
- Don’t be afraid to stage and commit often. Better too often than not often enough.
- A branch is a division unit of work, to be merged with other units of work.
- A tag is a pointer to a moment in the history of a project.
- A repository can have one or multiple remotes (we will revisit these later).
- Local branches often track remote branches.
- A remote serves as a full backup of your work.
