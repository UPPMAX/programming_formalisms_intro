# Summary

```{instructor-note}
- Summary 10 min
```

You now have acquainted yourself with the tools you will use in this course.
These are also helpful in your development work.

## The development cycle

Typical workflow:

    Requirements

    Analysis and design

    Development

    Test

    Development and maintenance

Iteration!

Important to identify problem in beginning and add for flexibility

## Planning phase with pseudocode and UML

- UML is good in several conditions
- The most important diagrams for software development are:
  -      Class
  -      Sequence
  -      Activity

-  There are plenty of tools out there

-   Pseudocode gives a more detailed description what you want the program to do.

    - Can be highly personal or very language-like

## Git and Github
- share your code
- open source

## Reproducibility

- Preserve the steps for re-generating published results.

- Hundreds of workflow management tools exist.

- Snakemake is a comparatively simple and lightweight option to create transferable and scalable data analyses.

- Sometimes a script is enough.

- Share your code! Eventually others will probably use it anyway.

- Licence your software and do it early. Default is “no one can make copies or derivative works”.

-  Get DOI or at least state how to cite your software

## Documentation
- Document in code, answering why, not how.

- Make a README.txt for an overview of the software. 
- Documentation should be tracked with the corresponding code in the same repository
- Full documentation or tutorial
- Deploy at GH-pages or ReadTheDocs

## Coming days
- Programming paradigms
- Testing and test-driven design
- Algorithms 
- Data structures
- Modular programming
- Optimization

```{admonition} Nordic Research Software Engineer
A Research Software Engineer (RSE) is someone in between research and technology (software, computing, data). Perhaps they work as a expert within a research group, or perhaps they work as a specialist in a service that supports other researchers.
