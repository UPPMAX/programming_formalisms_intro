# Exercise in group

```{instructor-note}
- Exercise 30 min
- Groups of 4-6 students

```

`````````{challenge} Make some documentation about UML coding in PlantUML

### Before start 
- One of you in the group (perhaps one who is familiar with this step) takes the responsibility to start a new Repository called by your group name/number (must start with a letter) in your Github account.
  - add README.md
  - no .gitignore
  - no licence
- Do this by sharing screen to your group mates and expalin what your are doing-
- Ask for the emails in your group.
  - chat is perfect for this

** You will work with a central repository **
- Go to "Settings" (upper right) for your new Repo.

```
- Go to "Collaborators" in left menu.
```{figure} img/add-people.png
:width: 100%
:class: with-border
```
- Add people by their email addresses.

### Individual work within group
- This is team work
- All changes can be done directly without asking and sending pull requests.
  - You will work with individual files so there is not danger to overwrite or get unresolved commits.
- You may mute yourself now and/or turn down speaker volume
- You may discuss with each-other to help with issues.
- Teachers will go around in breakout rooms.

### The task

- Select among the UML diagram types: Activity, Sequence and Class
  - Get inpired from <https://plantuml.com/>
  - If you are 4 people: choose 2 of the diagram types
- Each of you will be resposible for one Markdown file (.md)  
- For each type: 
    - 1 works with the declaration for the specific diagram and how to script it in PlantUML-
      - Get inspired byt the "Declaration... " and "Relations..." section for the actual diagram.
    - The other makes a full diagram connected to your work.
    - You can test at [PlantUML webserver](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000)
    - But results shall be given in Markdown.
      - Show both Code and rendered figure 
        ``````text
        ```PlantUML
        @startuml
        ...
        @enduml
        ```
        ``````
      - With the browser extensions for PlantUML these should be seen directly in preview.
