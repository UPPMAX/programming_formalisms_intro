## Containers

Popular container implementations:

- Docker

- Singularity (popular on high-performance computing systems)

- Apptainer (popular on high-performance computing systems, fork of Singularity)

- podman

They are to some extent inter-operable:

- podman is very close to Docker

- Docker images can be converted to Singularity/Apptainer images

- Singularity Python can convert Docker files to Singularity definition files
